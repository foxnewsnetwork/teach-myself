# Hello Gatsby

I've finally decided to maintain an actual presentable blog instead of just using markdown files, gists, etc., to capture documentation.

This is simply the "hello world" post so don't expect much content here.

Next time (as in this weekend), I plan to discuss the following two topics

- What is the quantum eraser effect?
  - What does it have to do with time travel?
  - Does *any* information travel backward in time?
- Explorations in to the slack API
  - How to setup a slack bot project
